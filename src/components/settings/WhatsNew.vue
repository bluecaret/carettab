              <h4 class="subtitle">All CaretTab Premium Access features now FREE!</h4>
              <p>
                After much consideration, I've decided to make all Premium features of CaretTab available for free. This
                decision stems from many reasons including the complexities involved in managing subscription services
                for browser extensions and a desire to branch out to other endeavors.
              </p>
              <h4 class="subtitle">A Shift in Focus</h4>
              <p>
                I am also excited to share that I will be exploring new horizons in Android App development. This shift
                means that while CaretTab will remain available and functional, my focus on its development will be
                reduced. This transition to free access ensures that CaretTab can continue to be a part of your daily
                routine, with less need for active management from my end. Please be assured that I plan to continue
                keeping CaretTab available for the foreseeable future.
              </p>
              <h4 class="subtitle">Current Premium Access Subscriptions</h4>
              <p>
                If you have a current Premium Access subscription, it will automatically be cancelled. You don't need to
                take any action regarding this change.
              </p>
              <h4 class="subtitle">Your Support is Valuable</h4>
              <p>
                Your support has been the driving force behind CaretTab. If you wish to continue supporting my
                endeavors, contributions are welcome at
                <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/bluecaret" target="_blank">Buy Me a Coffee</a>. Your generosity
                fuels my passion and allows me to explore new creative avenues.
              </p>
              <h4 class="subtitle">Feedback and Suggestions</h4>
              <p>
                As always, your thoughts and feedback are invaluable. They have shaped CaretTab into what it is today
                and will continue to be a vital part of its journey.
              </p>
              <p>
                Thank you for being with CaretTab through its evolution. Your understanding and support mean the world
                to me as I venture into new areas of development.

                <li>

                <li>Added a small preview of blueprints so you know what you are getting into.</li>

                </li>
                <li>

                  Weather layouts. Now choose between several layouts for the weather widget including some utility
                  layouts that make it easier to show a single detail for extra customization.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The weather icons have been updated and are now animated* and multi-colored. And yes, you can

                <li>
                  Improved use of storage space in your browser. This allows even more widgets and content before
                  hitting the storage limit. A warning will also show in case you do get close to that limit anyway.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Default wallpaper. CaretTab now comes out of the box with a beautiful photo of a Juniper plant as the

                <li>
                  Rebuilt the entire extension from scratch in a new, modern framework. This will make it easier and
                  quicker for me to build out more features in the future.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Saved settings been tweaked for better performance and space utilization. The result in this is an
                  unfortunate clearing of your saved settings. I tried to migrate as many settings as I was able.
                </li>
                <li>Smaller file size!</li>
                <li>
                  Dynamic scaling is no longer an option. This option added too much complexity and issues with the
                  improved positioning system.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Global size is no longer an option. Each widget has a default size applied, and can be changed
                  independently.
                </li>
                <li>All fonts are available under the free plan.</li>
                <li>All fonts other than the default Source Sans 3 now require internet to load.</li>
                <li>
                  Color themes and random color theme options have been removed. These may come back in a different
                  manner in the future.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Tab title no longer relies on an added clock to show the time/date. You can now set the title's own
                  timezone and time format.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Offset and margin options have been removed as they are no longer needed with the new positioning
                  system.
                </li>
                <li>Settings panel only has dark mode now. Light mode may return in the future.</li>
                <li>
                  Due to so many changes, translations have been completely redone using DeepL. This means some
                  translations are possibly worse now. Contact me if you notice any major issues.
                </li>
                <li>Clock styles (digital, analog, binary) have been split into individual widgets.</li>
                <li>All analog clock face and hand styles are now available in the free plan.</li>
                <li>The notepad widget is now available in the free plan. Add multiple notepads with Premium.</li>
                <li>The message widget is now called Quotes with a new optional Author field.</li>
                <li>New extension logo!</li>
